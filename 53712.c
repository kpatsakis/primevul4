		 * 1st case (trivial): there are no concurrent activities using
		 * fuse_set/release_nowrite.  Then we're on safe side because
		 * fuse_flush_writepages() would call fuse_send_writepage()
		 * anyway.
		 *
		 * 2nd case: someone called fuse_set_nowrite and it is waiting
		 * now for completion of all in-flight requests.  This happens
		 * rarely and no more than once per page, so this should be
		 * okay.
		 *
		 * 3rd case: someone (e.g. fuse_do_setattr()) is in the middle
		 * of fuse_set_nowrite..fuse_release_nowrite section.  The fact
		 * that fuse_set_nowrite returned implies that all in-flight
		 * requests were completed along with all of their secondary
		 * requests.  Further primary requests are blocked by negative
		 * writectr.  Hence there cannot be any in-flight requests and
		 * no invocations of fuse_writepage_end() while we're in
		 * fuse_set_nowrite..fuse_release_nowrite section.
