	 * Keep looping until we have no more ranges in the io tree.
	 * We can have ongoing bios started by readpages (called from readahead)
	 * that have their endio callback (extent_io.c:end_bio_extent_readpage)
	 * still in progress (unlocked the pages in the bio but did not yet
	 * unlocked the ranges in the io tree). Therefore this means some
	 * ranges can still be locked and eviction started because before
	 * submitting those bios, which are executed by a separate task (work
	 * queue kthread), inode references (inode->i_count) were not taken
	 * (which would be dropped in the end io callback of each bio).
	 * Therefore here we effectively end up waiting for those bios and
	 * anyone else holding locked ranges without having bumped the inode's
	 * reference count - if we don't do it, when they access the inode's
	 * io_tree to unlock a range it may be too late, leading to an
	 * use-after-free issue.
