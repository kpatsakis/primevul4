	 * PEBS is unreliable due to:

	 *   AJ68  - PEBS PMI may be delayed by one event
	 *   AJ69  - GLOBAL_STATUS[62] will only be set when DEBUGCTL[12]
	 *   AJ106 - FREEZE_LBRS_ON_PMI doesn't work in combination with PEBS
	 *
	 * AJ67 could be worked around by restricting the OS/USR flags.
	 * AJ69 could be worked around by setting PMU_FREEZE_ON_PMI.
	 *
	 * AJ106 could possibly be worked around by not allowing LBR
	 *       usage from PEBS, including the fixup.
	 * AJ68  could possibly be worked around by always programming
	 *	 a pebs_event_reset[0] value and coping with the lost events.
	 *
	 * But taken together it might just make sense to not enable PEBS on
	 * these chips.
